  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Political Science major at William Paterson University, graduating in May 2025. I’m preparing to attend law school and ultimately pursue a legal career at a leading company like Apple. 
    I’ve developed strong skills in communication, legal analysis, and technical problem-solving through both academic and work experience—particularly at Apple, where I’ve held multiple roles in technical support and repair. I believe in the power of clear writing, confident speaking, and purposeful design. 
    I’m passionate about advocacy, leadership, and helping others understand complex ideas. This website showcases my professional growth, completed projects, and career preparation work completed in ENG 3000.</p>

    <em>Reflection:</em> Between Week 1 and Week 7, I learned how to sharpen my message and be more confident in what I offer. The improved pitch is clearer, more specific, and better aligned with my goals. Practicing helped reduce filler words and made my delivery smoother.</p>
